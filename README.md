## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- For styles

### What I learned

Application of CSS variables for the colors, it made it much easier to reuse predifined colors...
Also the use of flexbox to position contents in the html page.


### Continued development

Yes there is still more work to be done as at this time of upload, from the design, there are two balls at the background, one at the top left and the other at the bottom right, currently having a challege palcing them in their proper position and also for them to adjust too to different screen size as well.
